    		<h1>Ellen DeGeneres</h1>
    		
    		<p>
        		Ellen is one of my most favorite people!
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		Here are some reasons why I admire her and enjoy watching her show:
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>She loves to laugh</li>
        		<li>She ends each show with "Be Kind to One Another"</li>
        		<li>She likes to play jokes on people</li>
        		<li>Her mission is to make people's lives better</li>
        		<li>She likes to help people and tries to make the world a better place</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
            With all the depressing news out there today, it is refreshing to watch Ellen's show and laugh.
